# Final Year Project

## Running The Program

To run the program, you will need Python 3.10.0 or later installed on your system. You will also need the Pygame package installed. To do this, you can run the following command in your command line interface:

pip install pygame

This command will download and install the latest version of Pygame from the Python Package Index (PyPI). After installation, you should be able to import Pygame into your Python scripts and use its functionality. Alternatively, you can install the package straight from an IDE, which is also necessary to run the program.

Lastly, all you have to do is run main.py from your IDE of choice. 

To change the algorithm that is in effect, you must uncomment the code for that specific algorithm. Don't forget to comment the algorithm you just used.
